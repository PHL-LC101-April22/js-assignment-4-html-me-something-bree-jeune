            <h3>Why I Decided to Change Careers</h3>

            <img src="images/ambulance.jpeg" alt="ambulance" width="100%">

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Recent times have left many healthcare workers feeling as though there is much to be desired. I began working in emergency medical services in 2014 with the hopes of reaching a demographic of people who needed care the most. Even though EMS is a rewarding job, I couldn't help but to think that there are other ways that I can change lives.</p>
           
            <p class="otherParagraphs">Unfortunately, like many other providers in this field, I began to experience physical and mental burnout. Being a paramedic is demanding work. Long hours, low emolument, the bodily demand and increasingly sicker populations tend to lend a hand to high turnover rates. </p>

            <h3>How It Started</h3>
            <img src="images/technology.jpeg" alt="computer circuit board" width="100%">
            <p class="otherParagraphs">As a kid, I always had a keen interest in technology. I recall times where I would take electronics apart and put them back together just so I could see how they were built and functioned. I also truly loved solving problems of any nature. However, if you asked me back then what I wanted to be when I grew up, without any hesitation, I would say a doctor.</p>

            <p class="otherParagraphs">Later in life, when I decided to go to college, I was at an empass. Believe it or not, I had no clue what to major in. The only thing I knew for sure, is that I wanted to help people. Pre-med would have been an obvious choice but I was too scared to declare it. I knew it would be hard work and time consuming so I opted for an easier route.</p>

            <p class="otherParagraphs">When the time finally came to make a choice, I decided that I was going to major in psychology. I understood that mental health was still a bit taboo but I knew too many people who had suffered emotionally from the unspoken. Ultimately, I would still be adjacent to the medical field and able to make a difference.</p>

            <img src="images/graduation.jpeg" alt="graduation" width="100%">

            <p class="otherParagraphs">I graduated within four years and then the tough choices came. Apply to medical school, apply to graduate school or enter the workforce? I decided again, I was not quite ready for advanced education so I decided to become an EMT. If I was going to be a doctor, I was going to be the best. Being an EMT, would allow me to gain hands-on experience and learn critical decision making in split-seconds. I spent the next few years progressing my skills and knowledge. At present, I operate as a critical care paramedic. I started this role just as the pandemic began to upsurge. This complicated matters greatly because the population of the sick and injured increased exponentially.</p>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>

            <p class="otherParagraphs">Three years later, the effects are still very palpable. I began to reconsider all the things I have ever been passionate about. In my free time, I had dabbled with programming languages like Python and Ruby. Nothing brought me greater joy than learning new things and problem solving.</p>

            <p class="otherParagraphs">Since becoming a LaunchCode student, I have learned to accomplish things I would have never imagined. I feel challenged everyday and motivated to succeed.</p>
